Introduction \n*Discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project*\n\n**Business Problem*: Opening a Chinese Restaurant in Toronto, Canada**\\\nIn this project we will try to find an optimal location for a restaurant. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an Chinese restaurant in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. \n\nToronto - the provincial capital of Ontario. With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\n\nStarting a restaurant with a recognized and popular cuisine can have great potential. We will analyze the neighborhoods in Toronto to identify the most profitable area based on population density and ethnicity diversity. Toronto is a great place to start the restaurant. It remains to be determined where the optimal location is.\n"

Toronto's Neighborhood information \n      Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n- b. Toronto's Neighborhood Geographical Information\n      Source: https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\n- c.

With out collected information of the location and type (category) of every restaurant, we can cluster all chinese restaurants to their respective neighborhoods. \n\nThe second step in our analysis will be \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" - the calculation and exploration of the following:\n- the 'restaurant density' across each neighborhood, borough and riding \n      * Each area can provide general to specific information to shareholders of their competitions \n- the 'population density' of chinese ethnic groups in each neighborhood \n\nIn third and final step we will focus on most promising areas and within those create clusters of locations that meet some basic requirements established in discussion with stakeholders. Using  Predictive Modeling over Inferential Statistical Testing, we will look into K-means clustering techniques. We will present map of all such locations but also create clusters (using k-means clustering) of those locations to identify general zones / neighborhoods / boroughs which should be a starting point for final 'street level' exploration and search for optimal venue location by stakeholders."

Results \n\n**D.1 Results**\\\nIn our search to identify one or more great neighborhoods to open a new chinese restaurant, it was noted that there was no major correlation between the Chinese population density & the Chinese restaurants density. \n\nContinuing our search, we looked into all the neighborhoods in Toronto with their respective chinese population density & number of chinese restaurants. We have used variety of data sources to set up a very realistic data-analysis scenario. We have found out that \u2014\n\nWe identified that the following ridings have a significantly high amount of chinese population density aka possible higher customer demand (from highest density to lowest):\n- Scarborough-Agincourt \n- Scarborough North \n- Don Valley North \n- Willowdale\n\nIn the following neighborhoods with their respective boroughs, we identified that these areas have existing chinese restaurants (from highest density to lowest). It would be important for shareholders to know that these areas would be the least ideal place for their restaurant location. \n- Bayview in North York\n- Westmount in Etobicoke \n- Don Mills in North York \n- St. James Town in Downtown Toronto \n\nWith the help of clusters examining & violin plots, it is better to consider only Scarborough-Agincourt and Scarborough North for the new restaurant\u2019s location. Since it has high number of Indian population which gives a higher number of customers possibility and lower competition since very less chinese restaurants in the neighborhoods.\n\n**D.2 Discussion**\\\nSome of the drawbacks of this analysis are \u2014 the clustering is completely based only on data obtained from Foursquare API and the data about the chinese population distribution in each neighborhood is also based on the 2016 census which is not up-to date. Thus there is huge gap of 3 years in the population distribution data. Even Though there are lots of areas where it can be improved yet this analysis has certainly provided us with some good insights, preliminary information on possibilities & a head start into this business problem by setting the step stones properly."

            "source": "## E. Conclusion:\nFinally to conclude this project, We have got a chance to on a business problem like how a real like data scientists would do. We have used many python libraries to fetch the data , to manipulate the contents & to analyze and visualize those datasets. We have made use of Foursquare API to explore the venues in neighborhoods of Toronto, then get good amount of data from Wikipedia which we scraped with help of Wikipedia python library and visualized using various plots present in seaborn & matplotlib. We also applied machine learning technique to predict the output given the data and used Folium to visualize it on a map.\nSome of the drawbacks or areas of improvements shows us that this analysis can be further improved with the help of more data and different machine learning technique. Similarly we can use this project to analysis any scenario such as opening a different cuisine restaurant or opening of a new gym and etc. Hopefully, this project helps acts as initial guidance to take more complex real-life challenges using data-science.\n\n\n\nAfter looking through the data collected and reformed in this report:\n\nPopulation Density (Ridings)\n\nThese four ridings are the most densely populated in terms of chinese ethnic group population. - Scarborough-Agincourt\n\nScarborough North\nDon Valley North\nWillowdale\nChinese Restaurants Competitors: With the help of clusters examing & violin plots, We identified that North York, Etobicoke and Downtown Toronto are the only boroughs that are populated chinese restaurants. In terms of neighborhoods, Don Mills, Bayview illage, are already densely populated with other chinese restaurants.\n\nE. Conclusion\nAfter careful consideration, the data suggests that it might be a good idea to open a Chinese restaurant in Scarborough-Agincourt \n- it has the highest Chinese population density in ridings, which gives a higher number of customers possibility\n- it has a much lower competition since there are very little chinese restaurants in the riding's neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \nOur analysis shows that although there is a great number of restaurants in Berlin (~2000 in our initial area of interest which was 12x12km around Alexanderplatz), there are pockets of low restaurant density fairly close to city center. Highest concentration of restaurants was detected north and west from Alexanderplatz, so we focused our attention to areas south, south-east and east, corresponding to boroughs Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain and south-east corner of central Mitte borough. Another borough was identified as potentially interesting (Prenzlauer Berg, north-east from Alexanderplatz), but our attention was focused on Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain which offer a combination of popularity among tourists, closeness to city center, strong socio-economic dynamics and a number of pockets of low restaurant density.\n\nAfter directing our attention to this more narrow area of interest (covering approx. 5x5km south-east from Alexanderplatz) we first created a dense grid of location candidates (spaced 100m appart); those locations were then filtered so that those with more than two restaurants in radius of 250m and those with an Italian restaurant closer than 400m were removed.\n\nThose location candidates were then clustered to create zones of interest which contain greatest number of location candidates. Addresses of centers of those zones were also generated using reverse geocoding to be used as markers/starting points for more detailed local analysis based on other factors.\n\nResult of all this is 15 zones containing largest number of potential new restaurant locations based on number of and distance to existing venues - both restaurants in general and Italian restaurants particularly. This, of course, does not imply that those zones are actually optimal locations for a new restaurant! Purpose of this analysis was to only provide info on areas close to Berlin center but not crowded with existing restaurants (particularly Italian) - it is entirely possible that there is a very good reason for small number of restaurants in any of those areas, reasons which would make them unsuitable for a new restaurant regardless of lack of competition in the area. Recommended zones should therefore be considered only as a starting point for more detailed analysis which could eventually result in location which has not only no nearby competition but also other factors taken into account and all other relevant conditions met.\n\nConclusion \nPurpose of this project was to identify Berlin areas close to center with low number of restaurants (particularly Italian restaurants) in order to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new Italian restaurant. By calculating restaurant density distribution from Foursquare data we have first identified general boroughs that justify further analysis (Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain), and then generated extensive collection of locations which satisfy some basic requirements regarding existing nearby restaurants. Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) and addresses of those zone centers were created to be used as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders.\n\nFinal decission on optimal restaurant location will be made by stakeholders based on specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like attractiveness of each location (proximity to park or water), levels of noise / proximity to major roads, real estate availability, prices, social and economic dynamics of every neighborhood etc.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-toronto-neighborhoods-to-open-an-indian-restaurant-ff4dd6bf8c8a"
